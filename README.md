## Description 
* “Deserted”,is a scene from a Virtual Reality World designed as beinga single puzzle piece of a much bigger Virtual REality game. The scene created will in the overall game server as a key view point, safe house and navigation landmark for players of the game. The terrain features rustic DIY constructed ladders and railings amid rusted metal railway scrap metal and treacherous terrain. The features are there to help emphasize the element of desertedness as well as create the sensation of loneliness and fear. The VR world was bulit with theme of isolation  as the overall environment that shall be surrounding this scene will encompass a strong  post-apocalyptic characteristic with horror undertones.
